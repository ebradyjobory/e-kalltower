<h2>Origins</h2>
<p>E - Kall ( <%=image_tag("E.png", :size => "20x16", :alt => 'E') %><%=image_tag("KAL.png", :size => "22x16", :alt => '-Kal') %> ) is "Great Building" in Sumerian, an ancient Mesopotamian language.</p>

<p>We initially managed procurement and small construction projects for the US military post 2003.</p>

<p>In 2007, we shifted our focus to general building and construction management for both the public and private sectors across Iraq.</p>
